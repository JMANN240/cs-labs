# CS2 Projects

## Bigint

Create a class which allows for an arbitrarily large integer. Implement methods on the class, including operator overloading. Does not use dynamic memory allocation. The goal is to perform arithmetic operations on very large numbers.

## String

Create a class that allows for the storing of ASCII strings. Dynamic memory allocation is used. Operator overloading is also implemented. Vectors are used at the end of the project as an introduction into STL containers. The goal is to read from Apache log files and parse their data.

## Assembler

Create a program that can read and infix expression and turn it into "assembly". This project teaches about stack data structures as well as different expression types (prefix, infix, postfix). A stack data structure must be implemented by the student, as well as the procedural logic of converting infix to postfix to assembly.

## Profiler

The student must work with a recursive Abstract Syntax Tree data structure to profile a given program. A C++ program is given, converted to XML using [srcML](https://www.srcml.org/), and then programmatically profiled. Dynamic memory is used.
