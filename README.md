# CS Labs

### This is a collection of all of the projects and labs that I did in CS23001 and CS 44001 respectively. 

### The CS2 projects have makefiles, as they are of a larger scale than labs. The CS3 labs are rather small and can usually be compiled with a simple single line. 

### In each of the directories I provide an abstract of the goals of each project/lab. It has been 2 years since I took CS2 and 1 year since I took CS3 so I may not be super precise.
