# CS3 Labs

## Lab 1

A warm-up exercise, so to speak, to get back into C++. Deals with command line arguments. The program should compare two files line by line and point out where 2 lines are different.

## Lab 2

Implement a container that holds words and how many times that word has appeared in a given file. Two classes needed to be implemented, one to hold a word occurence which contained information about a word and how many times it has appeared in the file, and another to hold a list of those word occurrences in a dynamic array.

## Lab 3

This was the first lab to use templates. The student has to implement a templated linked list. It was a fairly straightforward lab to demonstrate the use of templates.

## Lab 4

This lab takes in a list of class rosters and prints each student and the courses that they take. One line contains a student's name and their courses. We also had to do this using a student object instead of just a string representing the student's name.

## Lab 5

This lab introduced the map container, the first associative container that we learned. It was pretty much like lab 4 using a different (and better) method.

## Lab 6

This lab's purpose is to demonstrate the many containers and methods available in the STL.

## Lab 7

In this lab we had to implement a custom hashmap class.

## Lab 8

This lab was the first of a series of labs that demonstrate design patterns that we would learn in class. This lab demonstrates the singleton and templated design patterns.

## Lab 9

This lab demonstrates the bridge and factory design patterns. 

## Lab 10

This lab demonstrates the adapter and prototype design patterns.

## Lab 11

This lab demonstrates the chain of responsibility, decorator, and observer design patterns. This is done by simulating a coffee shop with multiple levels of baristas and customers who order drinks.

## Lab 12

This lab demonstrates the composite and visitor design patterns through a genealogical tree that the student must traverse in different ways.

## Lab 13

This lab demonstrates the registry, memento, and command design patterns. The student has to implement a history of commands such as undo, redo, and write.

## Lab 14

This was an extra lab that the professor had me do for honors credit. It demonstrates the flyweight design pattern by simulating an air traffic control center.
